                        <p>This project is a collaborative effort between the University of Alaska Anchorage's Departments of Computer Science and Human Services. Its goal is to create a digital system that translates and stores art and photographic images in a database. This database is intended to support various human services and health care initiatives, particularly for individuals who are vulnerable and marginalized.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Applications of the Repository:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Research:</strong> Facilitate research into Outsider Art and Outsider Artists. This can provide insights into the unique perspectives and experiences of these creators.</li>
                                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Educate health and human services practitioners about the impact of negative stereotypes and discrimination on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Arts Programs:</strong> Support arts programs aimed at improving the health and well-being of vulnerable individuals. By showcasing their art, the project aims to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of their experiences.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <h4><u>Benefits</u></h4>

                        <li><strong>Enhanced Visibility:</strong> Provides a platform for Outsider Artists, offering them visibility and recognition that they might not otherwise receive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Informed Practitioners:</strong> Helps practitioners better understand the needs and experiences of marginalized individuals, leading to more empathetic and effective service delivery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support for Arts Initiatives:</strong> Promotes the use of art as a tool for health and well-being, potentially leading to more supportive and therapeutic arts programs.</li>
