The last four months have been as precious as gems because I spent them in my home, in my bed, doing absolutely nothing.

This phase literally feels like a scene from the movie VIP (Velaiyilla Pattathari)...

My dad wakes me up with a scolding, but I stay in bed. He then goes to the extreme and turning off the fan to make sure I wake up! Finally, I rise around 9 AM. After some personal tasks, I have breakfast and catch up on TV. Then, I open my laptop to check my emails...

I then roam the internet X, LinkedIn, Reddit, and returning to YouTube to watch videos. Lunch time comes, and I eat like a king...

After lunch, I always take a nap to rest :) But, don’t get me wrong being unemployed for so long really takes a toll on your mental health. It was tough trying to find a job, and the struggle was real.

Every other person, including relatives, asks, "Where do you work?"

And my response? "I work at a big MNC company."

Then they ask, "How much do you make?"

I confidently reply, "1 lakh per month!"

Yes, I lied. I know, I know... it burns them inside! You can practically see their stomachs twisting as they wonder, “How did he land that?”

At 7:00 PM, my brain finally decides to wake up. I get to work—doing some open-source contributions, completing pending tasks, and applying for 20-30 jobs through LinkedIn, Indeed, and Naukri. But... no responses. None.

By 10:00 PM, I start to reflect on my day. That’s when the depression kicks in. If I don’t share my bad times, my head feels like it’s about to explode. That’s why I blog and journal, to let it all out and feel a little better.

And when I finally get into bed, sleep doesn’t come easily. So, I reach for my secret weapon to drift off to sleep. Here it is!
