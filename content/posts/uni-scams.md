I think Indian private universities are just scamming students with low-paying jobs with high-paying tuition fees!!!

When I was enquiring about colleges before joining! Some so-called top private colleges quoted their fee as 1.5-2 Lakh rupees per year! But I chose a low-fee college, which costs only 50K per year! 

After finishing my college, those so-called top private college students are also unemployed!!!

Whom to blame? Students skill issue? College exposure?

I think both! because Most of the colleges didn't give exposure to their students! And students also didn't come forward to upskill them!

At the end, colleges use those skill-deficient things and allow some institutions for skill development! But college is the place to teach and upskill the students, right? But they are allowing these things in college with some commission cut!!!

In my college, also one institute came in the last year to "upskill students" which cost around 8k for 1 month! Many students joined that... because they were given a certificate for internship completion!!! The faculty is also forcing students to join them! 

My simple one-question to students and teachers!!!

"What will you learn from one month than four years of college?"

"What will they teach in one month than four years of college that the faculty has to do?"

College has to give exposure and encouragement! By conducting tech events and encouraging them to attend the tech conferences!
