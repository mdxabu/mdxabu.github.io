Happy Birthday, My Friend!

First of all Happy Birthday, my friend! ðŸŽ‰

I still remember the very first time I saw you back in college, sitting behind me. Honestly, I was a little scared at first. You looked totally stoned, and I thought, *"I better stay away from this guy..."*

But then, surprise! You turned out to be on the same bus route as me. Slowly, we started talking, and I realized youâ€™re actually a really cool guy.

One thing Iâ€™ve always respected about you: you just donâ€™t care not in a careless way, but in a *"nothing shakes me"* kind of way. Whether itâ€™s studies, work, or the chaos around youâ€¦ you stay calm, unbothered, and fully in your own world.

Except when it comes to Genshin Impact. Then itâ€™s 200% effort, no compromise!

But jokes apart, what really stood out to me is your genuine character.

I remember once when we were eating snacks, I carelessly threw my trash on the ground. But you? You quietly picked yours upâ€¦ and even picked up mine. You didnâ€™t say anything. You just did it. That moment stuck with me. Thatâ€™s the kind of thing that inspires others without even trying.

So today, on your birthday, I just want to say thank you for being you.

Wishing you more great games, Unemployment and a year full of good vibes.
