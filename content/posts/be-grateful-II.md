I see that many people are mostly selfish, and they are neither honest nor polite.

Why aren’t people true to themselves and grateful for what they already have?
Maybe they have never witnessed a miracle, never faced serious hardship, or never received help from others during difficult times. When someone has never struggled, they may fail to understand the value of kindness and honesty.

Many people care only about themselves. Their mindset is often: *“I need profit. I don’t care about anyone else.”*
This way of thinking slowly destroys trust, humanity, and peace in society.

Let me give a scenario:

A 19-year old student comes from a very poor family. His parents somehow manage to buy him a laptop so he can study and improve his future. Unfortunately, the laptop doesn’t work. The boy has no technical knowledge, so he takes it to a laptop service center. The problem is actually very small, but the shop owners or workers try to scam him because they know he doesn’t understand the issue. The boy ends up paying much more than necessary.

Now ask yourself: who truly suffered a loss?

At first glance, it may seem like the boy lost money. But in reality, the real loss belongs to the shop owners or workers. They lost their honesty, their integrity, and a part of their humanity. Money gained through dishonesty never brings real peace or happiness.

I strongly believe in this principle:

> **For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.**

Life always balances itself. Cheating, lying, or exploiting others may bring short-term benefits, but it creates long-term consequences—loss of trust, guilt, and inner emptiness. On the other hand, kindness, honesty, and gratitude build strong character and lasting respect.

Being polite and kind costs nothing, but it can change someone’s life. We never know what struggles another person is carrying. A little honesty and compassion can make the world a much better place.

So, be polite.
Be honest.
Be kind to everyone.

Because in the end, character matters more than profit.
