Lately, I’ve been thinking about how often people try to interfere with decisions that are really no one’s business but your own. Not just close family, but people outside that circle. Distant relatives, neighbors, family friends, and sometimes even people who barely know you. They ask questions like, “Why didn’t you tell me first?” or “You should’ve asked me,” as if your personal choices need to go through some kind of approval system.

It’s not that advice is a bad thing. Guidance is valuable when it comes from the right place, and when it’s offered, not pushed. But interference is different. It’s when people expect to be part of decisions that don’t affect them. It’s when they treat your independence as a problem or worse, an insult.

What bothers me is that these reactions often come after you’ve made a responsible, and right choice. You didn’t act recklessly. You didn’t hide anything. You just didn’t involve them and that’s what seems to offend them. Not because they’re worried about you, but because they feel left out or overlooked. Sometimes it feels less like concern and more like ego.

and the guilt that comes with this? That’s the worst part. You start to question whether you should’ve asked more people, even when you know your decision was fine. You worry about people talking or being upset, even though the choice didn’t affect them. It’s exhausting and unfair.

at some point, you have to draw a line. You have to remind yourself that not everyone needs to be consulted. That your life isn’t a group project. That it’s okay to move forward with something without looping in every opinion. Taking control of your own decisions isn’t rude — it’s part of growing up. And just because someone tries to interfere doesn’t mean you have to let them.

I didn't mean that they don't provide valuable insights, There are some people providing it but these kind of people think like You have to choose my decision!

You can respect people without handing them control. You can listen without agreeing. And you can move forward without explaining every step to everyone. Because in the end, the person who has to live with your choices, is you.



One question keep shouting on my mind!

*"Why do I have to ask someone that I want to do?"*


You don't need to ask someones permission to do in your life, 

*"It's your Life, Live it"*

Some people give advice that’s genuinely helpful and valuable, take it if it lifts you up.
But if it’s meant to drag you down? Don’t give a fuck.

Not all peoples are bad :)

Be grateful for what you have, and proud of what you're working toward.
