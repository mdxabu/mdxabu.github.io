I don't know why I feel depressed these days. Every morning, I wake up to my parents scolding me, and my days go by with very low energy and negative thoughts.

If any problem occurs at home because of me, they bring up my unemployment. I'm just about to finish college in two weeks.

Day by day, my mental health is declining...

I don't understand why parents scold their children about getting a job after college. There are no students who haven't tried to get a job, everyone tries their best. What can they do if they don't get one?

Many religious extremists have approached me, asking me to join them for four months. I told them I am committed to other work for the next three months, but they simply said to leave that and come with them. I'm a religious person, but I know how to handle my faith.

Right now, my mindset is just to get a job in another city or state and move out of my hometown.

Everyone is pressuring me to do something with my life, but I'm still doing something b@st@rds. I really need to talk openly with someone!

I'm fucking tired, guys. Very tired...
