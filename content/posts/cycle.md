First of all, play the music above and read this blog :)

I had a long story about my cycle. When I was a child, around 12-13 years old, everyone had a cycle, but I kept asking my parents to buy me one, and they didn’t. My elder brother got one, a nice one, and I never did. After so many years, I finally got a used cycle from my brother's friend for just 500 INR. But I loved that cycle so much! I saved money and renovated parts of it whenever I could.

Days went by smoothly and happily, but one day something changed. I went to the mosque for a night prayer and, when I came back, my cycle was gone. I searched everywhere, but I couldn’t find it. I realized that someone had stolen my cycle.



A few days later, my classmates told me, “I saw your cycle with this one guy.” I took my parents and went to his house. He was the same age as me, and he had repainted the cycle and added some stickers. It might sound silly, but I decided to go to the police station. One officer came with me to talk to his parents, but another officer said, "We gave this cycle to him." Apparently, the cycle had been sitting near the police station for a long time, and no one had claimed it. That boy had also lost his cycle and filed a complaint, so the officers gave him my cycle.

I don’t blame anyone because, honestly, no one did anything wrong.

I asked him for my cycle back, and he said, “I put money into painting it.” So, I gave him some money, took my cycle back, and was happy to have it again! After a few years, I gave it to a friend who didn’t have a cycle. Unfortunately, he lost it irresponsibly.


After 7-8 years, I hadn’t owned a new, fresh cycle. One day, my dad asked me, "Do you want a cycle?" I said, “Yes.” The next day, my brother and I went to a cycle showroom and bought my new cycle. I’ve had it for four years now...

I’m still happily riding it with my earphones in!
