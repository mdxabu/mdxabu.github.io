In India, there are many fraudulent loan apps out there, like Instant Loan Apps, which offer loans of amounts such as 1000 rupees or some limited amount.

Just think: why would they give you money without any formal process, unlike a bank? A bank is the correct institution for providing loans.

These kinds of apps ask for permission to access your contacts, gallery, and other data on your mobile. Many people click "Allow" without reading the permissions carefully. As a result, they can view and download your gallery images and contacts.

Once you pay money to these apps, they may blackmail you using deepfake images. They may threaten to share these images with all of your contacts. Some individuals have even been pushed to take their own lives because of this.

***Please be aware of these scams!*** I'll attach some articles related to these fraudulent activities below.
