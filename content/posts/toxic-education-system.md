## The Art of Useless Electives

I've held onto a lot of vengeance toward my college because of their actions and the useless courses they force on computer science students. Every semester, we have to pick 2-3 open elective subjects. There are so many actually useful electives for computer science like cloud computing or application development, but what do they pick? Social studies and environmental science. Completely unrelated! They choose these subjects because they're easy to teach, not because they're relevant. And even then, they can't teach them properly. Absolutely fucking not.

## The Patent Factory: Where Innovation Goes to Die

Now I'm in my final semester, and all we should have is the project. But no, the college insists we must do a conference or journal for the project, and even file a patent. According to university rules, we don't need a conference or patent for the final project, but my college demands it anyway. Conferences and journals are fine, they can be useful but they have no clue how patents work. Most teams just buy their projects from solution centers. We did our project entirely on our own, but the college says if a team has a conference certificate, journal certificate, and patent, they won't get the "O" grade. And what about the teams who actually built their projects from scratch? They only get an "A+" or "A" grade. Focusing on conferences or journals is one thing, but patents? That's just ridiculous! So many students buy their projectsâ€”how can they get patents? They just throw money at it. These patents are worthless. WTF, this needs to stop!


## Grading: The Ultimate Obedience Test

Why should I have to compromise my grade for this nonsense? I could question them, but most students just do what they're told for grades. I can't even ask questions as a team or as students. And don't get me started on the reviews, my college has five official reviews, while the university only requires two. Only fully paid students can participate, and professors are always asking, "Did you pay the fees?" If not, you're excluded. My brain is screaming to call this out!

Once I finished my college I'll post every fucking thing in my blog...
