**"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment."**


Most of us are just worried about future and past of what we did! I think, we don't need to care about those things and just live in a moment and do what you get! we are never truly living when we are lost in yesterday’s regrets or tomorrow’s anxieties. The present is the only point of contact with reality and the only place where peace, clarity, and action are possible.

focus only on what is within your control, the present.
