Alaskan Season of Code is a volunteer-based, remote coding program where students collaborate on open-source projects, learning not just technical skills, but also how to work within a diverse, interdisciplinary environment. The program is designed to connect students with faculty mentors from the University of Alaska.

# My Role in the Program
I was fortunate enough to participate in this program from May 1st, 2024, to September 15th, 2024, under the mentorship of Dr. Pradeeban Kathiravelu, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Alaska Anchorage. During the internship, I worked on the Beehive project, a data federation approach to analyze behavioral health and complement healthcare practices with community health metrics in Alaska.

The goal of the Beehive project is to create a platform that supports marginalized communities by offering a holistic approach to healthcare, integrating behavioral health and community health data. Through this, we aim to develop a system that could potentially improve mental health practices in remote areas, offering a model that can be adapted to similar situations globally.

# A Word of Thanks
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Pradeeban Kathiravelu for his mentorship and support throughout this project. His guidance not only helped me develop technical skills but also gave me invaluable insights into the intersection of technology, healthcare, and social change. I also want to thank the entire team at the University of Alaska Anchorage for running such a wonderful program and providing students like me with the opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful projects.
