It’s been five months now, five months of not having a job, not having a clear path.

Some days feel like a break, like I finally have time for myself.
I enjoy the quiet, the lack of pressure. I sleep in, relax, and do things I never had time for before.
But then there are days when it hits me hard. I feel stuck, like I’m not moving forward.

I see others working, growing, and I can’t help but feel like I’m falling behind.
At first, my parents asked, “What’s your next move?”
Now, they don’t even ask anymore. It’s like they’ve given up on expecting anything from me.
That silence is tough. It feels like I’m just floating, like I’m invisible.


I remind myself this is just a phase, but it’s hard to shake the feeling of failure.
I know I shouldn’t feel like this. I know I should be patient.
But some days, it feels like being unemployed is silently eating me up inside.


I know I’m not the only one going through this, but it still feels lonely.
Maybe I needed this time to figure out what I really want.
Maybe I’m learning more about myself than I think.
Even if I don’t have all the answers now, I trust that things will get better.

The future is still wide open.
For now, I’ll take it day by day, even when it’s hard to see the next step.
Because even when nothing seems to be happening, something is always happening inside.


I just have to keep reminding myself that this is only a chapter, not the whole story.
