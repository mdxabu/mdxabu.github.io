I want to share a childhood incident that made me grateful for everything and taught me to be patient.

Between the ages of 12 and 16, all my friends had bicycles. I also asked my parents to buy me one, but they didn't.

In 2021, I finally got my first bicycle. By then, my friends had moved on to motorbikes, but I didn't want to ride them. All I ever wanted was a bicycle because childhood dreams never fade not just about a cycle, but about everything in life.

***I believe everything comes to you at the right time. There's no need to rush!***

Another incident comes to mind. In 7th grade, I was a low-performing student, ranking 34th out of 40. But my teacher never treated me harshly. instead, she encouraged all the struggling students. Guess what? I made it to the top 4! You might say it's not a big deal, but it was for me. If she had treated me badly, I might have stayed at the bottom.

Be grateful for what you have and what you had. Be kind, and help those who are still learning!
