This year was actually really good, like surprisingly good. I learned a lot of things in tech, broke a lot of things in tech, fixed some of them, and confidently called the rest “features.”

Somewhere between endless Stack Overflow tabs, coffee refills, and “why is this not working??” moments, I grew a lot as a developer and as a human.

# Tech Stuff Happened. A Lot.

This year, I learned so many things in tech that my brain occasionally felt like it needed a full reset. New tools, new concepts, and bugs that appeared out of nowhere just to keep me humble.

But honestly, that’s what made it fun. Every bug fixed felt like a small victory. Every crash taught me patience. Every “aha!” moment reminded me why I enjoy building things.

# Google Summer of Code 2025 - Yep, That Actually Happened

One of the biggest highlights of my year was being selected for Google Summer of Code 2025 with Organization Alaska. It still feels a little unreal when I say it out loud.

GSoC wasn’t just about writing code. It was about reading documentation (yes, I survived), writing code that other humans actually read, realizing my code could always be better, and understanding how open source really works.

A huge thank you to Pradeeban, whose guidance and support meant a lot throughout this journey. Having a mentor who answers questions, gives honest feedback, and pushes you to grow makes a massive difference.

I worked on a Network Measurement tool :)

# Open Source Life and Beehive Adventures 

This year, I did a lot. I’m now maintaining projects in Beehive, which sounds cool and actually is, but it also comes with responsibility, issues, pull requests, and the occasional “how did this even break?” moment.

At the same time, I worked on my own fun projects. These were the projects with no deadlines and no pressure, just curiosity and vibes. Some worked, some didn’t, and some are still living peacefully in my “I’ll finish this later” folder.

# Tech Events I Almost Attended (But Didn’t… Yet)

I also tried to attend some tech events this year, but for various reasons, I couldn’t make it happen. Timing, travel, life, and probably my poor planning skills all played a role.

But instead of feeling bad about it, I decided something important: 2026 is the year I attend tech events. Not just attend—I want to actually talk to people, learn from the community, and yes, I’ve decided that I want to give a talk. Saying this out loud feels scary, but also exciting, which probably means it’s the right goal.

# Interviews: The Emotional Rollercoaster

Ah yes, interviews.

I gave so many interviews this year. Some went great. Some were okay. Some made me stare at the ceiling and rethink everything for about a day.

I was a good fit for roles and still got rejected. That part hurts. But it also taught me something important: rejection is part of the process, not the end of the story.

Every interview made me better, more confident, more prepared, and slightly less scared of the “tell me about yourself” question.

# Ending the Year with Hope (and Coffee) 

Even after all the rejections, I’m hopeful. I truly believe this year will be a great start to finally land a job. I’m entering it with more experience, better skills, and much stronger confidence than before.

This year taught me that progress isn’t always clean or linear. Sometimes it’s messy, sometimes it’s slow, but it’s still progress.

So here’s to writing better code, breaking fewer things, learning nonstop, showing up to tech events, and eventually standing on stage giving a talk.

2025, you were chaotic, educational, and kinda awesome.
Let’s see what the next year compiles into 

# A Small Discord 

I created a Discord server to communicate with fellow contributors and open-source enthusiasts.

It became a place to share ideas, ask questions, help each other debug, celebrate small wins, and occasionally panic together when something broke. Building and maintaining that small community reminded me that tech isn’t just about code, it’s about people.

**Disclaimer:** This server is primarily for discussing open source projects that are currently being built. It is not focused on GSoC, LFX, or other open source programs.
