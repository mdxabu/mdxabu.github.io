# Zed

![](https://miro.medium.com/1*CGXsIg5wiNKwvdgQZ3boZg.png)

I use Zed as my primary code editor! Zed is an open-source code editor for Linux, macOS, and Windows written using the Rust programming language. It was started by Nathan Sobo, one of the creators of Atom, and is developed by Zed Industries. The editor itself is free to use, but users must pay to use some of the AI features.

This code editor is sleek and distraction-free! Unlike my brain, which is neither of those things.

# Spicetify

Spicetify is a tool that allows you to customize Spotify's user interface and functionality. It's an open-source project developed by the community. Spicetify lets you change the look and feel of Spotify, add new features, and even create your own themes.

Spicetify is a great tool for anyone who wants to customize their Spotify experience. It's easy to use and has a large community of users who are always willing to help.

I mainly use it for AdBlock 🤫 (don't tell Spotify). The best thing is the community plugin support, so many developers have created useful plugins! It's like a buffet of features, except you don't feel guilty afterward.

# SDKMAN

SDKMAN is a lifesaver for anyone who wants to manage multiple versions of software development kits. It's easy to use and has a large community of users who are always willing to help.

I use this for Java because when you work on multiple projects, they all have different versions of Java... If you configure them manually, it's about as fun as assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. SDKMAN makes it painless!

# Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh is a framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes with a ton of plugins and themes that make your terminal look and feel fantastic.

Oh My Zsh is a great tool for anyone who wants to customize their terminal experience. It's easy to use and has a large community of users who are always willing to help.

I use the "robbyrussell" theme for my zsh because I'm a person of simple tastes (and also because it looks cool).

# Brave

Brave is a privacy-focused web browser. It's open-source and is developed by Brave Software. Brave is a great alternative to Chrome and Firefox for those of us who don't want to be tracked like animals in the wild.

I use it mainly for adblock and to hide distracting content like popups! Because apparently, websites think I want to subscribe to their newsletter within 3 seconds of visiting. Spoiler: I don't.

There's another version of Brave called "Brave Nightly" which provides the latest features and improvements. Brave Nightly is a great way to try out new features before they're released to the public. But regular Brave only contains tested and properly working features!

# Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator that's blazingly fast and easy to use. It's open-source and is developed by Hugo Authors. Hugo is a great alternative to Jekyll and WordPress (minus the constant security updates that make you question your life choices).

I use it mainly for my personal blog and portfolio!

This website is also a Hugo site... Meta, right?

# VLC Media Player

VLC Media Player is the Swiss Army knife of media players. It plays literally everything files you forgot existed, formats that shouldn't work, videos from the future, probably even your thoughts if you ask nicely.

I use VLC because it just works. No codec drama, no "this file format is not supported," just pure, unadulterated video playback. The traffic cone icon is also iconic. Literally.
