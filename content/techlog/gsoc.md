# Let Me Be Honest For A Minute
Every year a wave of students suddenly becomes deeply passionate about open source the moment they hear something about stipends, selections and resume glory. It is almost poetic. What is less poetic is the fact that most people treat open source like a limited time festival instead of an actual community. If your motivation begins and ends with a program name or a payout, you are already starting on the wrong foot.

This is supposed to be about community. About shared effort. About learning and contributing. Not a seasonal treasure hunt.

# Choose The Community Not The Program

If the first thing you ask yourself is which program pays more or which name sounds more impressive, then you are approaching open source with the enthusiasm of someone selecting a fast food combo. These programs exist to strengthen communities, not to hand out bragging rights. Pick a project because you care about it or because you genuinely want to learn from it. Not because it shows up on an official list once a year.

# Contribute Because You Want To Be There

You can always tell who appears only during application season. They enter the chat with the same energy as someone walking into a gym for the first time in January. Everything is urgent. Everything is about proving something. Everything is about getting selected.

Genuine contributors take their time. They explore. They ask meaningful questions. They find their place in the community without constantly thinking about a selection announcement. They contribute because they care about the work, not because they need a screenshot for an application.

# Engage Like A Human Being Not An Applicant

Mentors are not judges sitting on a talent show panel. They are contributors who want to work with people who communicate clearly and respectfully. If every message you send sounds like you are trying to score points, you are not building trust. You are performing.

Talk normally. Ask questions when needed. Offer help when you can. Interact without calculating how every action affects your chances.

# Understand Before You Contribute

Open source is not a race to push code as fast as possible. It is a collaborative environment where understanding the project is far more valuable than typing speed. Spend time reading the documentation. Study the structure. Learn the context. The smartest contributors are the ones who observe before they act.

# If Money Is The Only Motivation Please Rethink

The stipend is a support mechanism, not the goal. If the only reason you want to join open source is because a program offers payment, there are far easier jobs with far less frustration. Open source is powered by community effort and shared purpose. The reward is growth, collaboration and recognition earned over time.


# Consistency Matters More Than Any Program

You do not need a program to be an open source contributor. Thousands contribute all year long without participating in any formal initiative, and many of them learn more than those who only appear for a few months. Consistent involvement builds trust, knowledge and opportunity long before any program does.

# The Reality You Need To Hear

If you only show up when a program opens, you are not joining a community.
If you vanish when selections are announced, you are not contributing.
If you treat open source like a competition, you are misunderstanding its purpose entirely.

# Final Thought


- Do not choose a program name.
- Do not choose a stipend.
- Choose open source. Choose the community. Choose the effort.

Opportunities will follow. Recognition will follow. Growth will follow.

Open source is not a season. It is a long term habit shaped by curiosity, patience and collaboration.
