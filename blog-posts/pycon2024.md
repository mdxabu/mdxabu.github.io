Beatboxing at PyCon India 2024 at 📍bengaluru
---

<p>I went to Bengaluru with my classmate friend for PyCon 2024 on a scholarship. 🎓 It was an amazing experience as I met many open-source enthusiasts and startups, and I made some great friends too. 🤝 One highlight was meeting <b>Mars Lee</b> from NumPy; we had a wonderful discussion about open-source projects. 💻 The food there was incredible! 🍽️</p>

<p>The beatboxing event during the closing ceremony on day 2 was a fantastic way to wrap up the conference. 🎤 I've even added some video footage that I captured from the event. 📹 It was definitely a memorable experience! Beatboxing at PyCon India 2024. 🎶</p>
