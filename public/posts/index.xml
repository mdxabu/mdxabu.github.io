      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know Why I&amp;rsquo;m feel depressed now a days, every morning woke up with my parents scoldings and days are going very low energy with negative powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any problem occurs by me in house, they came up with the unemployement I just going to finish the college in just two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day my mental health is going down&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why parents are scolding their childrens for getting job after college, there are no students who aren&amp;rsquo;t tried to get a job, everyone tried their best to get a job, what would they do if they get a job?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;deepfake-technology-a-double-edged-knife&#34;&gt;Deepfake Technology: A Double-Edged Knife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepfake technology, which involves the manipulation of images, videos, or audio using artificial intelligence, has emerged as one of the most dangerous advancements in recent years. While deepfakes have legitimate uses in entertainment, such as resurrecting deceased celebrities for films or creating AI-generated voices for songs, their negative impact has been growing—particularly in the world of scams and blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-deepfake-technology-and-its-uses&#34;&gt;What Is Deepfake Technology and Its Uses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepfake refers to the use of AI tools or advanced video editing software to create realistic images, videos, or audio that are manipulated to mislead viewers. It has found positive uses in the entertainment industry, with AI-generated voices from late singers and the recreation of deceased actors&amp;rsquo; appearances for films. However, this same technology is being exploited for more malicious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Waste a CS Degree 101: A Masterclass by My College</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-art-of-useless-electives&#34;&gt;The Art of Useless Electives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve held onto a lot of vengeance toward my college because of their actions and the useless courses they force on computer science students. Every semester, we have to pick 2-3 open elective subjects. There are so many actually useful electives for computer science like cloud computing or application development, but what do they pick? Social studies and environmental science. Completely unrelated! They choose these subjects because they&amp;rsquo;re easy to teach, not because they&amp;rsquo;re relevant. And even then, they can&amp;rsquo;t teach them properly. Absolutely fucking not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alaskan Season of Code</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/asoc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alaskan Season of Code is a volunteer-based, remote coding program where students collaborate on open-source projects, learning not just technical skills, but also how to work within a diverse, interdisciplinary environment. The program is designed to connect students with faculty mentors from the University of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, you can read about the program &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/uaanchorage/GSoC/blob/main/Alaskan-Season-of-Code.md&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-role-in-the-program&#34;&gt;My Role in the Program&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to participate in this program from May 1st, 2024, to September 15th, 2024, under the mentorship of Dr. Pradeeban Kathiravelu, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Alaska Anchorage. During the internship, I worked on the Beehive project, a data federation approach to analyze behavioral health and complement healthcare practices with community health metrics in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beware of Fraudulent Loan Apps: The Hidden Dangers and How to Protect Yourself</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/fraud-loan-apps/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/fraud-loan-app.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;fraud apps&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, there are many fraudulent loan apps out there, like Instant Loan Apps, which offer loans of amounts such as 1000 rupees or some limited amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think: why would they give you money without any formal process, unlike a bank? A bank is the correct institution for providing loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of apps ask for permission to access your contacts, gallery, and other data on your mobile. Many people click &amp;ldquo;Allow&amp;rdquo; without reading the permissions carefully. As a result, they can view and download your gallery images and contacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Open Source Journey in 2024</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/opensource2024/</link>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-open-source-journey-in-2024&#34;&gt;My Open Source Journey in 2024&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I decided to take my open-source contributions seriously, and it&amp;rsquo;s been an incredible learning experience. I’ve had the opportunity to explore some fantastic open-source projects, tools, and communities, without any bias, and I’ve learned a great deal along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-with-the-docker-maven-plugin&#34;&gt;Starting with the Docker Maven Plugin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.pexels.com/photos/1250452/pexels-photo-1250452.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;amp;w=1260&amp;amp;h=750&amp;amp;dpr=1&#34; alt=&#34;banner&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My open-source journey began with a contribution to the popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin&#34;&gt;Docker Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt;. While my contribution was relatively small—updating dependency versions and refactoring a few methods—it taught me a lot about the process of contributing to open-source projects. I was guided through this experience by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rohanKanojia&#34;&gt;Rohan Kanojia&lt;/a&gt;, who showed me the ropes of contributing within an organization and maintaining quality in a collaborative environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
