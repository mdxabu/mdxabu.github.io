      <title>The Night You Decide to Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There comes a night was very quiet, a little heavier than usual and you realized that you’ve messed up your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in a dramatic or world-ending way, but in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.redd.it/v9v4h2rb3y4b1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t hit all at once. It arrives in waves,
A little shame.&lt;br&gt;
A little fear.&lt;br&gt;
A little “Who have I become?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, something surprising shows up,
&lt;strong&gt;Guilt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Be Grateful and Kind</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/be-grateful/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share a childhood incident that made me grateful for everything and taught me to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the ages of 12 and 16, all my friends had bicycles. I also asked my parents to buy me one, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, I finally got my first bicycle. By then, my friends had moved on to motorbikes, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to ride them. All I ever wanted was a bicycle because childhood dreams never fade not just about a cycle, but about everything in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depressed.</title>

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I feel depressed these days. Every morning, I wake up to my parents scolding me, and my days go by with very low energy and negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any problem occurs at home because of me, they bring up my unemployment. I&amp;rsquo;m just about to finish college in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day, my mental health is declining&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why parents scold their children about getting a job after college. There are no students who haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to get a job, everyone tries their best. What can they do if they don&amp;rsquo;t get one?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Waste a CS Degree 101: A Masterclass by My College</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-art-of-useless-electives&#34;&gt;The Art of Useless Electives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve held onto a lot of vengeance toward my college because of their actions and the useless courses they force on computer science students. Every semester, we have to pick 2-3 open elective subjects. There are so many actually useful electives for computer science like cloud computing or application development, but what do they pick? Social studies and environmental science. Completely unrelated! They choose these subjects because they&amp;rsquo;re easy to teach, not because they&amp;rsquo;re relevant. And even then, they can&amp;rsquo;t teach them properly. Absolutely fucking not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
