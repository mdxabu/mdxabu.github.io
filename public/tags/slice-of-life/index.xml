&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I feel depressed these days. Every morning, I wake up to my parents scolding me, and my days go by with very low energy and negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any problem occurs at home because of me, they bring up my unemployment. I&amp;rsquo;m just about to finish college in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day, my mental health is declining&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why parents scold their children about getting a job after college. There are no students who haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to get a job, everyone tries their best. What can they do if they don&amp;rsquo;t get one?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-art-of-useless-electives&#34;&gt;The Art of Useless Electives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve held onto a lot of vengeance toward my college because of their actions and the useless courses they force on computer science students. Every semester, we have to pick 2-3 open elective subjects. There are so many actually useful electives for computer science like cloud computing or application development, but what do they pick? Social studies and environmental science. Completely unrelated! They choose these subjects because they&amp;rsquo;re easy to teach, not because they&amp;rsquo;re relevant. And even then, they can&amp;rsquo;t teach them properly. Absolutely fucking not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
