      <description>&lt;p&gt;This trip was everyone&amp;rsquo;s dream and I got the chance to go!!! It was my first international trip and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even seen many places in Tamil Nadu itself like Ooty and Kodaikanal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Google Summer of Code 2025 first stipend, I planned to perform Umrah in August itself, and I started to enquire about the Umrah packages from different travel agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I booked with one travel agency. After I booked, many people from my neighborhood told me that there were cheaper agencies out there and asked why I chose that one instead of the cheap ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who Decides for You?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been thinking about how often people try to interfere with decisions that are really no one’s business but your own. Not just close family, but people outside that circle. Distant relatives, neighbors, family friends, and sometimes even people who barely know you. They ask questions like, “Why didn’t you tell me first?” or “You should’ve asked me,” as if your personal choices need to go through some kind of approval system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday, My Friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all Happy Birthday, my friend! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the very first time I saw you back in college, sitting behind me. Honestly, I was a little scared at first. You looked totally stoned, and I thought, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I better stay away from this guy&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.redd.it/t751qzpfuvzd1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, surprise! You turned out to be on the same bus route as me. Slowly, we started talking, and I realized you’re actually a really cool guy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life can be unpredictable, with sudden downfalls, but some small things can make you feel overwhelmed and great about living!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a moment like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I feel low sometimes, at that time someone I see coincidentally and my inner self jumps to the sky &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Night You Decide to Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There comes a night was very quiet, a little heavier than usual and you realized that you’ve messed up your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in a dramatic or world-ending way, but in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.redd.it/v9v4h2rb3y4b1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t hit all at once. It arrives in waves,
A little shame.&lt;br&gt;
A little fear.&lt;br&gt;
A little “Who have I become?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, something surprising shows up,
&lt;strong&gt;Guilt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Be Grateful and Kind</title>
      <link>http://localhost:51939/posts/be-grateful/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:51939/posts/be-grateful/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share a childhood incident that made me grateful for everything and taught me to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the ages of 12 and 16, all my friends had bicycles. I also asked my parents to buy me one, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, I finally got my first bicycle. By then, my friends had moved on to motorbikes, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to ride them. All I ever wanted was a bicycle because childhood dreams never fade not just about a cycle, but about everything in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depressed.</title>
      <link>http://localhost:51939/posts/depressed/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I feel depressed these days. Every morning, I wake up to my parents scolding me, and my days go by with very low energy and negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any problem occurs at home because of me, they bring up my unemployment. I&amp;rsquo;m just about to finish college in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day, my mental health is declining&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why parents scold their children about getting a job after college. There are no students who haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to get a job, everyone tries their best. What can they do if they don&amp;rsquo;t get one?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Waste a CS Degree 101: A Masterclass by My College</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-art-of-useless-electives&#34;&gt;The Art of Useless Electives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve held onto a lot of vengeance toward my college because of their actions and the useless courses they force on computer science students. Every semester, we have to pick 2-3 open elective subjects. There are so many actually useful electives for computer science like cloud computing or application development, but what do they pick? Social studies and environmental science. Completely unrelated! They choose these subjects because they&amp;rsquo;re easy to teach, not because they&amp;rsquo;re relevant. And even then, they can&amp;rsquo;t teach them properly. Absolutely fucking not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
