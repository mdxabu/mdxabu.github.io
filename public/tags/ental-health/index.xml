      <title>Be Grateful and Kind</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share a childhood incident that made me grateful for everything and taught me to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the ages of 12 and 16, all my friends had bicycles. I also asked my parents to buy me one, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, I finally got my first bicycle. By then, my friends had moved on to motorbikes, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to ride them. All I ever wanted was a bicycle because childhood dreams never fade not just about a cycle, but about everything in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
