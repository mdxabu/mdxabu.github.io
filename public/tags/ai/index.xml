      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence feels less exciting and more frightening for many people. What once seemed like a helpful and creative technology is now raising serious concerns about safety, responsibility, and long-term impact. AI systems are becoming more powerful and more accessible, and when that power is placed into open social platforms without strong safeguards, the results can be dangerous. Instead of supporting healthy conversation and creativity, some tools are being misused in ways that harm individuals and society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re living in an interesting time. AI coding assistants have become ubiquitous in modern software development. GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and countless other tools are writing millions of lines of code every day. And while there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with using AI to boost productivity, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing phenomenon that&amp;rsquo;s becoming impossible to ignore: &lt;strong&gt;AI-generated code has a fingerprint&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who reviews code regularly, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed patterns that scream &amp;ldquo;AI wrote this!&amp;rdquo; louder than a syntax error in production. The most glaring? &lt;strong&gt;Emojis in documentation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;obsessively structured comments&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me explain why these patterns are dead giveaways and what they reveal about the current state of AI-assisted development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
