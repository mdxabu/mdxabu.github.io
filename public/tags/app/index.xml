      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence feels less exciting and more frightening for many people. What once seemed like a helpful and creative technology is now raising serious concerns about safety, responsibility, and long-term impact. AI systems are becoming more powerful and more accessible, and when that power is placed into open social platforms without strong safeguards, the results can be dangerous. Instead of supporting healthy conversation and creativity, some tools are being misused in ways that harm individuals and society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/fraud-loan-app.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;fraud apps&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;fraud apps&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, there are many fraudulent loan apps out there, like Instant Loan Apps, which offer loans of amounts such as 1000 rupees or some limited amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think: why would they give you money without any formal process, unlike a bank? A bank is the correct institution for providing loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of apps ask for permission to access your contacts, gallery, and other data on your mobile. Many people click &amp;ldquo;Allow&amp;rdquo; without reading the permissions carefully. As a result, they can view and download your gallery images and contacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
